<h3>Officer and Non-Commissioned Member – What’s the Difference?</h3>

<p>The Non-Commissioned Member (NCM) is the backbone of the military. NCMs start out as recruits and are then trained to do specific occupations in the CF. Some are trained as technicians to keep the equipment repaired; some are operators that use specific and complicated electrical and mechanical equipment; and some are users of general equipment.</p>
<p> At 11th Field Regiment, NCMs can work in a variety of areas: on the Gunline, operating the 105mm C3 Howitzer; in the Command Post, Fire Effects Detachment or Reconnaissance Party as a driver, radio operator or technician; or in a number of other vital positions. With experience and leadership training, NCMs increase the amount of responsibility that is put upon them. All leadership qualified NCMs are employed as instructors. Sergeants and Master Bombardiers are employed as Detachment Commanders. Warrant Officers can be employed as Troop Sergeant Majors. Master Warrant Officers are employed as Battery Sergeant Majors and the Regimental Sergeant Major usually is a Chief Warrant Officer.</p>
